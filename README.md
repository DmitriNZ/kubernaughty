# kubernaughty

This is a collection of documentation, how-tos, tools and other information on
debugging and identifying Kubernetes/container workload failures, performance
and reliability considerations, and other `kubernaughties`.

There are many gotchas, mud pits and blind spots running distributed systems,
and kubernetes is no different. Hopefully, this stuff helps you and your
team.

Currently, focused on in-depth diagnosis for IO / Resource contention.
IO, resource contention notes, docs and tools.
